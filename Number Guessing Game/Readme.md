# Number Guessing Game

   This script is a number guessing game. It is my personal implementation of the beginner python project that is available on [roadmap.sh](https://github.com/Osholarin/Roadmap.sh/edit/main/Number%20Guessing%20Game/Readme.md). I hope that my code as it is might be used to understand the basic logic of a simple number guessing game.

## How to use
    :Usage
        $ python main.py

## Current features
-   Tracks the amount of tries it takes a user to guess the number

### Future Updates:
- Allow the user to play multiple rounds of the game (i.e., keep playing until the user
decides to quit). You can do this by asking the user if they want to play again after each
round.

- Add a timer to see how long it takes the user to guess the number.

- Implement a hint system that provides clues to the user if they are stuck.

- Keep track of the userâ€™s high score (i.e., the fewest number of attempts it took to guess
the number under a specific difficulty level).
